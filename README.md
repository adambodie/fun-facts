**Kevin's Fun Facts**

I initially built this app from a Treehouse course: _Building a Simple Android App with Kotlin_, to introduce me to Andoird development and Kotlin.  Building off of what I learned in the course, I added Firebase to retrieve data from its Realtime Database, rather than store the data locally.  In addition, I used animation to give each fact a scaling property.  As for the name of this App, it is named for a co-worker who provided the facts featured in the app.
